Four isotopes of livermorium are known, with mass numbers between 290 and 293 inclusive; the longest-lived among them is livermorium-293 with a half-life of about 60 milliseconds. A fifth possible isotope with mass number 294 has been reported but not yet confirmed.\n\n> ([[more information from Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livermorium]])"},{"title":"Tennessine","atomicnumber":"117","element":"Tennessine","symbol":"Ts","atomicmass":"295","numberofneutrons":"178","numberofprotons":"117","numberofelectrons":"117","period":"7","group":"17","phase":"artificial","radioactive":"yes","natural":"","metal":"","nonmetal":"yes","metalloid":"","elementtype":"Transactinide","atomicradius":"","electronegativity":"","firstionization":"","density":"","meltingpoint":"","boilingpoint":"","numberofisotopes":"","discoverer":"","year":"2010","specificheat":"","numberofshells":"7","numberofvalence":"7","text":"> Tennessine is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Ts and atomic number 117.

It was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, near Moscow, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of the international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP. It was formally named on 28 November 2016. The name honors the nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, who played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. It is one of only two elements named after a person who was alive at the time of naming, the other being seaborgium, and the only element whose eponym is alive today.\n\n> ([[more information from Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oganesson]])"},{"title":"$:/_/my/headers","atomicnumber":"Atomic Number","element":"Element","symbol":"Symbol","atomicmass":"Atomic Mass","numberofneutrons":"Number of Neutrons","numberofprotons":"Number of Protons","numberofelectrons":"Number of Electrons","period":"Period","group":"Group","phase":"Phase","radioactive":"Radioactive","natural":"Natural","metal":"Metal","nonmetal":"Nonmetal","metalloid":"Metalloid","elementtype":"Element Type","atomicradius":"Atomic Radius","electronegativity":"Electronegativity","firstionization":"First Ionization","density":"Density","meltingpoint":"Melting Point","boilingpoint":"Boiling Point","numberofisotopes":"Number of Isotopes","discoverer":"Discoverer","year":"Year Discovered","specificheat":"Specific Heat","numberofshells":"Number of Shells","numberofvalence":"Number of Valence"}]
