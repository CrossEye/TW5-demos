TW5 Demos
=========
 
This is a place for various minor TiddlyWiki work, including

  - A [demo][d1] of a technique I was [asking about][tto5494] in
    [talk.tiddlywiki][tto] to list the status of known tiddlers, whether
    complete, TODO, or missing.

  - A [reworking][d2] of a small bit of Charlie Veniot's [Basic Anywhere
    Machine][ba] based on a [discussion][tto5767] of portal sites.

  - A demonstration of my [glossary technique][d3] built on a simple
    excerpt-list macro.

  - A proof-of-concept of an [accordion macro][d4] combining tiddlers

  - A so-far-unsuccessful attempt to [add `Type`s][d5] similar to `Tag`s.

  - A [question][d6] for [talk.tiddlywiki][tto] about how to float the output
    of a ViewTemplate alongside the other body content.

  - The [Periodic Table][pt] in tiddlers.  This also has [`tiddler.json`][ptt],
    with all the data tiddlers being used and [`enhance.zip`][pte], with the
    code used to transform them from a predecessor format.
    
    - [Version 1][ptv1] demonstrates the basic idea
    - [Version 2][ptv2] cleans up the presentation a bit

    Note that this work has moved to [TW5-Chemistry][ch], a more permanent, more
    active home.

  - Notes on [documentation][do] for Tiddlywiki

  - An initial [sample output][d7] for the POC [markdown-to-tiddlywiki][m2t] script

You might want to see also more substantial work hosted elsewhere, such as

  - The [WizardNav plugin][wn], which adds previous/next footers to specified
    tiddlers
  - The (pre-pre-alpha) [Nearby plugin][nb], which adds a footer linking to nearby
    tiddlers, based on links, tags, fields, and (eventually) transclusions
  - The Periodic Table and other [Chemistry][ch] work.
